The inferred FSM models consist of abstract states; the events in the model lose concrete information so they can be executable, such as parameters, data types. Moreover, to effectively apply combinatorial testing in the next step, we need to define input classes for each input parameter.

XInputMiner tries to infer:
  * Concrete mapping information (e.g. executable event, parameters) so that an event of a FSM model can be turned into a corresponding executatale one.
  * Input classes for each input parameter 

Inputs for the component are the logs and FSM models, output is a Domain Input Specification file that contains all the data mention above.
