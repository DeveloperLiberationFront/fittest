#summary Fully-Automated GUI Testing.

= Introduction =

The unpredictable and varied way in which users can interact with systems will be one of the problems that will become increasingly important over the lifetime of the FITTEST project and beyond. Users of these systems may be humans (who are inherently unpredictable) and other automated or semi-automated systems, interacting in ways possibly not envisaged by their designers.

We have created a fully automatic GUI crash testing framework. It uses the operating systemâ€™s Accessibility API to recognize GUI controls and their properties and enables programmatic interaction with them. It derives sets of possible actions for each state that the GUI is in and automatically selects and executes appropriate ones in order to drive the GUI and eventually crash it. The tool uses a machine learning algorithm called Q-Learning to generate short, fault- effective and reproducible crash sequences, which a normal human user would not come up with.

= Details =

  * Uses the operating system's accessibility API to obtain information about the SUT's state
  * Uses this information to derive possible actions (Clicks, Drag-Drop-Operations, Keyboard-Input, ...)
  * Selects and executes actions that maximize the likelihood of crashing the SUT
  * Operates completely unsupervised, i.e. automatic
  * Allows replay of erroneous sequences
  * Allows custom test oracles and action behavior
