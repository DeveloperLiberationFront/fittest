= Introduction =

FSM2CT component generates classification trees, each represents one path that is generated from the input model FSM. Moreover, in each tree T-Way combinatorial testing is applied to generate abstract test cases. These test cases are store in the trees as well.

The tool is part of the transformationtools suite
