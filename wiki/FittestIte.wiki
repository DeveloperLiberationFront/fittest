The FITTEST ITE (Integrated Testing Environment) is a tool for the automated test of Future Internet applications. It integrates a tool suite of new and improved testing tools for continuous automated testing. A continuous testing cycle using the ITE consists of the steps shown in the following Figure

The ITE activates the logging of the SUT, and collects the 
generated logs. We can either log real usages by end users of the
application in the production environment, or log test cases execution
in the test environment.

The ITE analyses the logs and infers a model of the SUT.  Whenever a
model change is detected, the ITE also initiates oracles inference
(e.g. log-based or model-based oracles), test cases generation, and
finally test cases execution.  To generate test cases, abstract test
cases are first inferred from the model by traversing the model
according to a proper criteria, such as transition coverage. Then,
they are concretised by means of search-based test case generation
(using a genetic algorithm).

The ITE executes the test cases and evaluates them using free oracles
(e.g. SUT crashes/hangs) and inferred oracles. Of course, it is
also possible to incorporate human written oracles.

The implementation of the tools for logging and test case execution 
depend on the technologies used by the
SUT. Currently the ITE supports Flash and PHP applications.
