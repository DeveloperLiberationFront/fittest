Haslog is a utility tool to process logs in the FITTEST format. The format is described the [http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/repo/CS-2012/2012-014.pdf UU-CS-2012-014] technical report. The format is text-based, well defined and deeply structured (e.g. allowing objects to be serialized into a log), but more compact than e.g. XML.

An example of an entry in a FITTEST log:

{{{
%<S "O:Person"
%<P %<{ I =0:ID }%>
%<{ name="Sponge Bob ":String }%>
%<{ age=4:int }%>
%<{ spouse=> }%> 
%>
%<S "O:Person"
  ... // here is the spouse object
%>
%>
}}} 

Haslog can for example compress a FITTEST log, or to convert them to XML to be processed by other tools. It can also do pre-processing and then convert logs to the Daikon format, so that you can use Daikon to infer invariants from them.
