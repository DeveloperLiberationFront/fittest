#UCL HHSA Hyperheuristic algorithm for CIT

= Learning Combinatorial Interaction Testing Strategies using Hyperheuristic Search =

Two decades of bespoke Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT) algorithm development have left software engineers with a bewildering choice of configurable system testing techniques.
