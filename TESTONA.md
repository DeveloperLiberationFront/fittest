TESTONA is a software tool for test design. It implements the Classification Tree Method presented by Grimm and Grochtmann.

The Classification Tree Method is a method for test design, as it is used in different areas of software development. It has been developed by Grimm and Grochtmann in 1993.
The classification tree method consists of two mayor steps:
  1. Identification of test relevant aspects (so called ''classifications'') and their corresponding values (called ''classes'') as well as
  1. Combination of different classes from all classifications into test cases.

The identification of test relevant aspects usually follows the (functional) specification (e.g. requirements, use cases â€¦) of the system under test.
These aspects form the input and output data space of the test object.

The second step of test design then follows the principles of combinatorial test design.

While the method can be applied using a pen and a paper, the usual way involves the usage of the Classification Tree Editor, a software tool implementing the classification tree method.
